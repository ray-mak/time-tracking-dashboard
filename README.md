<h1>My Process</h1>
<p>The first thing I typically do is look at the desktop and mobile layout for the design. This gives me an idea of how I will group and organize my elements. Once I have the layout completed, I worked on the Javscript to make the page interactive.</p>

<h2>Built With</h2>
I completed this challenge with: 

- HTML
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascrupt


<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to use and format CSS grid. I also learned how to use async functions and fetch to retrieve data.</p>
